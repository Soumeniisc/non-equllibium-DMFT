%The study of the temporal evolution of systems undergoing symmetry breaking phase transitions—whether it is incondensed-matter physics, cosmology or finance 1–6 —is difficult because they are hard to repeat, or they occur very rapidly.\\

Here t is the nearest neighbor hopping and, U the Hubbard repulsion has been  $\Delta$ is the staggered one body potential which doubles the unit cell. When $\Delta$ is zero it is exactly Hubbard Hamiltonian. \\

Phase diagram of this model is studied $\cite{soumen,ArtiHM}$. In non interacting case it is charge density wave(CDW) band insulator. As one increase U in this model CDW stat are suppressed and band insulating phase crossover to correlated metal state. If you increase U farther at certain critical $U_c$ there will be metal to Mott insulating transition in para-magnetic calculation. We want to study at certain U(BI,M,MI) if one suddenly turn on $\Delta$ in HM how CDW phase appear in the system.  Previously in Hubbard model(HM) interaction quench problem already done for both para\cite{HUB_para,RMP,HUB} and AFM phase\cite{HUB_AFM,HUB} using IPT-DMFT. Double occupancy, jump of the distribution function across fermi level has been studied. %Some people also studied the Melting of CDW state in the system.
