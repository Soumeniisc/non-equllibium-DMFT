In fig \ref{density} density at A and B sub-lattice evolution is plotted as as interaction is quenched from $U_i$ = 0 to $U_f$ = 1.0, 2.0,3.0 where ionic staggered potential is kept fixed at $\Delta=1.0t$. All the cases intial state is at beta=16. IN the density plot lower set of lines are for A sub lattice and uper set are for B sublattice which is negetive orbita potetial compare to A. Corresponding arrows are for euilibium density at A and B sublattice at beta=16. Effective temperature of the system after interaction quench is calculated below and at those temperature equllibium density is give.
%for the Hubbard model we see that steady double occupancy is larger than the equilibrium value. where as for IHM case its is lower 

\section{Energy}
Energy at $\gamma$ =\{ A, B\}  sublattice is defined as
\be 
E_{\gamma} = \Delta * n_{\gamma} + E_{k\gamma} + U_f*d_{\gamma}\\
\en 
where $n_{\gamma}$ is the occupation andd $d_{\gamma}$ is double occupation at $\gamma$ sublattice and $E_{k\gamma}$ is kinetic energy = $-2\int G_{\gamma}(\tau) G_{\bar{\gamma}}(\beta - \tau)$
