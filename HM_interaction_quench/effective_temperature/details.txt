code
====
its only does the paramagnetic equllibium calculation for hubbard model. 

analysis
========
we sees the effecting teparature calculated is matching with the liturature data.

data
====
data was produced to calculated effecting teperatue HM after quench. data was produced for beta = 1.0 to beta= 10.0 for U =0.0, 3.3.
