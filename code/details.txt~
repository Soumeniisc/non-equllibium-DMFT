src_original_HM_para
====================
its contain the original version of the code. only for dn(t) calculation a subroutine measure_dn(parm_,dmft_) and measure_dn2(parm_,dmft_) added in the noneq-dmft.f90 on 04/05/17. where first one is the only calculated retarded part of local_green(t,0) where as seond module calculate  all part  of local_green(t,t') using volterra integral but only reatred part is benchmarked for (t,0). other components of loca green's function at diffent time need to be benchmarked. 

this code giving the result matching with the liturature data almost. In the literature result was given for bold 2 no order IPT but this code is bare 2nd order IPT. even dn(jump in the distribution function) also mathiching with the liturature data.

src_original_IHM_para
=====================
its started on 01/04/17
 it contain code for sudden interaction quench, ramp interaction quench, orbital potetial quench version of the code.
